 # FAQs
  1. When the news get updated?<br/>The news will be updated at around 5:30 PST. Sometimes, we run late due to workload. Apology in advance.
  2. How do we generate news?<br/>
  We have a team of techies/content-writers, who actively hunts for the latest fresh news and curates the most important ones. Then they draft and post it to our site.
  3. What data do we collect from the user?<br/>
  None. We do not collect any user information such as email address, contact number etc. However, as our community will expand, we are planning next version. It will include some exciting features which will require user sign up flow. But still, we will make sure, we collect minimal data from the user. 
  4. Do we have app?<br/>
  Currently, No. But we are developing apps in android and iOS
